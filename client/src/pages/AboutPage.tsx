                Software Engineer with experience in C#/.NET and building robust, 
                system-oriented software solutions. I have hands-on experience developing
                and maintaining backend systems, real-time data pipelines, and integrations
                in production environments, and I thrive when working with complex 
                codebases that require analysis, troubleshooting, and system understanding.
                
                Through both industry experience and my master’s thesis, I have worked
                extensively with distributed systems, automation, and system interfaces,
                where I have been collaborating closely with developers, stakeholders,
                and project teams. I strive to become the best at what I do and therefore
                want to contentiously learn as much as possible about software.
